            <h2 id="Definitions of Love">Definitions of Love</h2>
            <p>
                Love is a word that has a variety of different meanings within
                different contexts. It is generally defined as a strong affection
                for another person, be it maternal, sexual, or based on admiration,
                and is sometimes even extended to objects or even food. There are
                differences in the concept of love even between cultures and
                countries, making it difficult to arrive at a "universal" definition
                of love.
            </p>

            <p>
                Love is sometimes categorized as either impersonal or interpersonal
                love. Impersonal love is that for an object, principle, or goal that
                a person may be deeply committed to or greatly value. Examples
                include the love of "life itself," love for a stuffed animal, or
                even love for a cause or idea.
            </p>

            <p>
                Interpersonal love is love between human beings. It can refer to the
                love that exists between family members, friends, or couples. There
                has been much speculation throughout history on the basis of love,
                some of which try to explain love in terms of a biological,
                psychological, and even evolutionary basis.
            </p>

            <p>
                Regardless of what any psychologist or "expert" says, how a person
                views or defines love is up to them, and the results of any online
                calculator or predictor of love should have little to no bearing on
                whether or not a person chooses to pursue it.

            <p>
                In general, we are attracted to people like ourselves. Middle-class
                people go for similarly middle-class types, and we look for those,
                within our class, who like the same kind of clothes, or music, or
                environment. Of course, sometimes we find ourselves very attracted
                to those who are totally unlike us, really opposites, and that's
                because we seek change and stimulation.
            </p>

            <p>
                Some say that we seek people like ourselves to form a more stable
                union, and to have children like ourselves. Well-known actresses
                pair up with rock stars, for example, because such men tend to be as
                rich and famous as they are.
            </p>

            <p>
                But the challenge of the unknown is great. Some say that we tend to
                fall in love with those who are mysterious and challenging to us,
                because they come to us with a very different gene pool. So the
                children will benefit from broader genetic input. But there's no
                scientific proof for such assertions.
            </p>

            <p>
                Physical features are important to both sexes, but a bit more so to
                men. There is some scientific basis for this. According to Louann
                Brizendine, a clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of
                California, San Francisco, and the author of "The Female Brain, the
                male brain processes the female image, while the female brain takes
                in a good looking male, but also shows judgmental activity, thinking
                about the guy's character at the same time.
            </p>

            <p>
                Love does take over most of your brain activity, Brizendine says,
                and once it has you hooked, it doesn't let you go. It keeps your
                chemicals hopping, which is why you can't seem to get the other
                person out of your head.
            </p>

            <p>
                But all the scientists admit that there's no real hard explanation
                for why one person goes for another, as opposed to another one.
                There will probably never be a science of love, nor any way to
                calculate what the results will be. So let your mind and your heart
                decide.
            
            </p>
            <h2 id="Dating">Dating</h2>
            <p>Dating is a stage of romantic relationships in which two individuals engage in an activity together, most often with the intention of evaluating each other's suitability as a partner in a future intimate relationship. It falls into the category of courtship, consisting of social events carried out by the couple either alone or with others. The protocols and practices of dating and the terms used to describe it vary vastly between cultures, societies, and time periods. Although dating is most often colloquially used to refer to the action of individuals engaging in dates with one other, dating can also encompass a wide range of activities which fall outside participation in dates.</p>

                <P>The meaning of dating also shifted during the 20th century to include a more informal use referring to a romantic, sexual relationship itself beyond an introductory or trial stage. Although informal, this meaning is very common and is used in formal speech as well as writing. Although taboo across most of the world for much of history, premarital sex has become increasingly common within the last century, beginning with the onset of the sexual revolution. Across a greater number of portrayals in film, television, and music, sex within dating has become increasingly accepted as a natural progression of the relationship.</p>
        <h2 id="Necessity of love">Necessity of love</h2>
        <p>Love allows people to attribute a sense of purpose for living.
             From the moment of birth, relationships are made: mother and child,
              father and child, grandparent and child, and the like. As people grow older
               and enter into schools, jobs, and get involved in their
                communities the number of relationships, they have grown, 
                as does their ability to maintain these relationships.
                 Love can have a powerful effect on the human body. 
                 Irving Singer wrote, 
                 "For a person in love … life is never without meaning."
                 A person's life is built the love between two people – their parents, the love they share for the friendships they make and eventually, the person they marry and have children of their own with. The feelings love brings: happiness, empathy, mutual respect, a sense of purpose, can lead to stronger motivation, less stress,
                  a positive outlook on life, and hope.</p>
                  <P>Love allows humans to communicate through their emotions. To love effectively, one has to love themselves first: to love another person's flaws and quirks, one has to love their own flaws and quirks.</P>
               <P>Humans are not the only species in the world that can feel love and its effects. Non-human animals can feel love as well, although it is less complex and less creative.Many animals feel emotions. When a dog wags its tail or licks its owner after being parted for a few hours, this is interpreted as happiness. When a person leaves for work in the morning and their dog cries at the window, it exhibits sadness. A growling dog who doesn't like it when someone touches its favorite toy is showing anger. Animals can feel love as well as other basic emotions humans feel. Dogs that grow up with siblings create strong bonds with their siblings. If their sibling dies, the dog can go into depression and refuse to eat.</P>
               <P>Love holds a higher significance than many people might assume. For example, Abraham Maslow, an American psychologist, developed a theory called "Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs". In this hierarchy, Maslow presents the different levels of priorities and needs we have as human beings. Maslow has listed physiological needs as the first essential need of human beings. Following physiological needs is safety needs which include the innate need for security, health, jobs, work, etc. Finally in third comes the need for belonging. Maslow describes this need as love, affection, family, friends, and intimacy. Although Maslow lists belonging on the third tier of the hierarchy of needs, one may argue that the sense of belonging, along with love and affection, could be the foundation of the pyramid of needs. When we explore the possibilities and actions that people take for love, it is clear how powerful it can be. For example, parents who are willing to risk their lives or die in the place of their child would be putting their belonging needs over their physiological need of safety.The motivation to express and feel love may overpower any physiological need that humans have.</P>
